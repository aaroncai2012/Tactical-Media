                    We at Riot are and were notorious for fostering an environment of sexual harassment, misogyny, and bullying for people who love making games and perpetuating that culture among our users.<br><br>
                    This was exposed in 2018 with a Kotaku article:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Women at Riot were regularly passed up for promotions for which they were qualified, interrupted or talked over in meetings or made to feel sexualized at the workplace.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Most sources were anonymous for fear of retaliation from colleagues, whom several described as “cultish” about Riot’s very specific culture. At the time the company was 81% male.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Both male and female sources have described seeing unsolicited and unwelcome pictures of male genitalia from bosses or colleagues.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Five months after Kotaku started reporting for this article, days after Riot apparently learned about it, the company added a “diversity and inclusion” page on its website.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="culture-image-container" style="background-image: url(./images/riot-culture-image.png)"> 
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="people-container">
            <div class="people-image-container" style="background-image: url(./images/riot-people-image.png)">
            </div>
            <div class="people-text-container">
                <h1 class="people-text">
                    <p>"Our people,</p>
                    <p>our culture"</p>
                </h1>
                <p class="body">
                    The article caused an outrage, and many more allegations came to light from current and former employees. In the aftermath, a gender-based discrimination class-action lawsuit was filed. Riot reached a $100 million settlement in 2021.<br><br>

                    Riot’s own statistics show that real progress has been made, according to their most recent Diversity and Inclusion report for 2021. While diversity data in the Riot report reveals how many women and marginalized groups are being hired, the numbers don’t detail the experiences of those employees, nor if the company is retaining them over time.

                    In 2016, Riot surveyed its own employees to study the correlation between in-game and workplace toxicity. It turns out that Rioters who received complaints about their in-game behavior were also awful to work with. According to that study, 25 percent of employees “let go” between 2015 and 2016 had “unusually high in-game toxicity.”<br><br>

                    League of Legends’ player base, which in 2012 was over 90 percent male, has earned a reputation for rampant sexist language that Riot has proactively addressed over the last few years. Anecdotal evidence suggests that women who play League of Legends have been regular targets of harassment, and data from Riot indicates that new players encountering toxic behavior are 320 percent less likely to return to the game.
