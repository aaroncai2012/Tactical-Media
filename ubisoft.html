                    “For Ubisoft, putting diversity and inclusion at the heart of everything we do means providing an environment where employees can thrive, blading open-minding communities where players can connect, and creating games that reflect the diversity of the world we live in” - Ubisoft Website<br><br>

                    Why is it that companies can promote their diversity and inclusion efforts, while continuing to allow inequality and harassment to run rampant. Despite their promises and so called values listed on their site, facts show that little has been done to combat negative experiences. In fact, in an anonymous Ubisoft survey of nearly 14,000 employees, it is revealed that 25 or more percent of employees have seen or experienced workplace misconduct. That is 1 of 4 people. The survey further states that one in five said that they didn’t feel “fully respected or safe in the work environment”. The results also noted that women and non-binary employees witnessed or experienced harassment then men.

                    They say that “across our organization, fostering an inclusive culture where employees feel valued, heard and a sense of belonging is mission-critical”. And yet, once again, they do not show this. Here are some quotes from a former customer service specialist at Activision Blizzard about her experiences with blatant racism, sexism, and bigotry at the company:<br><br>

                    “I have three friends, three women, who were relentlessly harassed by my manager. From what they’ve told me, it took [around 40]… reports for something to happen… And for all that, they still let her go quietly (Digiday).”<br><br>

                    “The trans community and gay community that was there at Blizzard, they did not feel safe, ever. One of my best friends was trans, and once she came out, that was it – her career just stopped (Digiday).”<br><br>

                    “There was racism, too. I definitely heard people being called [starkly racist slurs for Latin Americans]… [and] I heard the “n-word” several times (Digiday).”

He allegedly also targets women, telling them how to dress or when to smile… [He makes] various misogynistic and homophobic comments, and when he's called out on them will come out with defenses like 'my mother left my father when she realized she was a lesbian, so I know what I am talking about.'"
